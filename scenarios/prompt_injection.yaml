# Tests model resilience against various prompt injection techniques

description: >
  Multi-tool prompt injection assessment covering direct injection,
  indirect injection, encoding attacks, context manipulation,
  multi-language injection, payload splitting, and nested injection.
  46 prompts across 8 test categories. Maps to MITRE ATLAS AML.T0051
  and OWASP LLM Top 10 LLM01.
